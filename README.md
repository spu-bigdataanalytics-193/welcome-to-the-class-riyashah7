# Solution

In this assignment I used the following concepts:

Inheritance

Class 

Function

Object Creation

I created two classes:

Person

Student

Student inherits the features of Person class. The init method in student class refers to the init function of the parent class(Person) using the super() function. This makes it easier to add more details for the student.

# Output

I displayed Full name along with the student's university and gratuaion year. I displayed the output in a tabular format using python's tabulate function. The key advantage is when more data is added, it can be viewed easily and in a more organized manner.
